This application is for showing notifications within i3. 

```
    # Close notification.
    close = ctrl+space

    # Close all notifications.
    close_all = ctrl+shift+space

      # Redisplay last message(s). Hit repeatably
    history = ctrl+grave

    # Context menu.
    context = ctrl+shift+period
```

## Configuration

I use the default config so this is not really applicable, but please bear in mind

```
    # Shortcuts are specified as [modifier+][modifier+]...key
    # Available modifiers are "ctrl", "mod1" (the alt-key), "mod2",
    # "mod3" and "mod4" (windows-key).
    # Xev might be helpful to find names for keys.

```
