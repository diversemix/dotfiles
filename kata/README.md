# kata

Practice makes perfect. 

This folder contains the kata for tooling and coding patterns used most frequently.
The kata are intended for use on a regular basis, the intension is booking a slot on a weekly basis to perform one or more.

Also plan is to build my own cheetsheat for each tool or language.
